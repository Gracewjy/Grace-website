                <p class="desc">Like many Chinese children, I spent my childhood in the suburbs with my grandparents, while my parents were busy working in the city center. Years later, when I returned to this place for the first time, I was confronted with the sight of its decay following my grandparents’ aging and passing away.
                    In the 1950s, Chinese Planned Economy brought my grandparents’ generation into “danwei” (work unit) residential communities. However, in the rapid wave of urbanization of modern China, the massive outflow of young people from suburban areas caused regional development imbalances. Suburbs that “could not keep up with the pace of development,” like countless elderly individuals who used to be active in the previous era but lost their vitality now, are becoming marginalized, neglected, and forgotten in city edges. 
                    I used black-and-white film photography to document the current state of this place I once called “home.” The once-vibrant playground I used to run around with my friends is now overgrown with weeds. Based on my childhood memories, I manually added color to the photograph, capturing fragments of time that had passed.
                    The photograph is displayed in a frame by the riverside under the bridge at Kings Cross, detached from the bustling and prosperous city center. As the webcam detects pedestrians, parts of the black-and-white photograph would be temporarily filled with color. This neglected place faintly flickers with color, as though memories long lost are awakened, and vibrancy and life are briefly regained. However, as people inevitably leave, the photograph turns back to black and white.
                    This is an “elderly’s” yearning for renewed vitality, yet also a silent resignation of solitude. The constantly shifting colors symbolize instability and fragility of these areas, melancholy and powerless. What lies ahead of our “home” and those forgotten places?
